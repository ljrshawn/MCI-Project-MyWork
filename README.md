# MyWork
***
A fully functional full-stack MERN web application comes with complete CRUD functionalities, authentication features, and chart visualizations to help users track their progress and performance over time. The application is designed to help teachers manage and check students' workload and project process, while also allowing students to record their working hours and check on their team members' progress. For the front-end, I utilized React and TypeScript, while for the back-end, I utilized MongoDB and Express. (JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, React, Express, Material UI and MangoDB)
